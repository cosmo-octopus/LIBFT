# Libft

**Libft** is an individual project at 42 that involves re-creating standard C library functions along with additional ones. This endeavor aids in building a library of useful functions for the program's progression. Although reinventing existing functions might seem counterintuitive, 42's approach is aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of data structures and fundamental algorithms. This project is carried out due to the restriction of using certain standard libraries in 42's projects, compelling students to develop their own library of functions to support their work.

> :warning: **Note:** It's crucial to avoid copying and pasting code without comprehending it, both for your own learning and the integrity of the educational process.

## About the Project

The project is structured into four sections:

1. **Libc Functions:** Replicating some of the standard C library functions.
2. **Additional Functions:** Creating functions deemed valuable for upcoming projects.
3. **Bonus Functions:** Constructing functions beneficial for manipulating linked lists.
4. **Personal Functions:** Developing functions anticipated to be useful in the future.

Although the code might not be optimal, it has successfully passed all 42 tests and has been utilized in other 42 projects.

## Note

- Most file and function names are prefixed with `ft`. This stands for "Forty Two," indicating their association with 42.
- The project instructions mandate that all source files be placed in the root directory. However, for the organization of this GitHub repository, the files are divided into subfolders.

## How Libft Works

The objective is to generate a library named `libft.a` from the source files. This library can then be used in other 42 projects. To achieve this:

1. After downloading or cloning this project, navigate to the project directory and execute the `make` command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/42YerevanProjects/42_Libft.git
$ cd 42_Libft
$ make
```

2. This should result in a `libft.a` file and associated object files (`.o`).

That's it!
